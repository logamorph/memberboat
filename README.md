# MemberBoat Project

MemberBOAT is a simple self-hosted web-application for managing an organization's membership list.  We really want to keep things simple, so we're not building much beyond the essential feature set:

  - Members are individual persons or subscribers (i.e. household)
  - Membership status and history
  - Integration with Stripe API
  - Multiple lists (optional)

## Download and Installing

Most hosting providers have what you need.  Requirements: PHP 5.3 + MySQL

## Contributing

If you can web-design or code, you're welcome to help.  This project is intended to be noob friendly.  Interest in local civics is a nice domain motivation to have.
